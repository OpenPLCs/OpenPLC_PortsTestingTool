// Package ptcal turns a set of calibration points into a correction.

// It is the only place that arithmetic happens, so the panel and a production
// run cannot disagree about the same measurements. The board reports what it
// intended to put out, a meter what came out; the rest is the host's
// (DECISIONS.md 22 and 38). Nothing here writes to a board: src/calstore
// produces the sector-15 image (PORTTOOL-FLOW.md C.3.2).
//
// A straight line is the smallest model that separates gain from offset; the
// residuals are reported so a non-linear converter shows instead of hiding in
// the gain.
