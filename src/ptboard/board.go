// Package ptboard owns the conversation with one board: it reads the serial
// line forever, sorts what comes back into replies, samples and log text, and

// Reading never stops - not during a command, a paused view or with nobody
// subscribed: an undrained OS buffer overruns within seconds and this link
// has no retransmission. Pausing is something the view does.
